## Context

In june starts the "Projet Genie Informatique" in which you will have to manage a computer science project as team using git and github. For that project to work you will need to organize your team efforts, collaborate and so on.

Create guide that answer the following question How can git and github help you manage a group assignement ?

Rules :

- Team of 5/6
- The Guide is a website hosted on github
- The Guide can have several pages but should have one index file that serves at the entry point.

## Pedagogical Objectives

- Learn by doing : Explore concepts and tools provided to you and try to use them in this project.
- Team based Project : Create and manage a small project as a team, use tools provided by github to help you.
- Learn about advanced concepts in git and github that help you manage your project.

## Advice for this assignment

### Example of a Planning

This is a group project:

- You should have group activity, to manage your team, share your work, learn from the other...
- You should have individual activity, to list the concept you need to explore, to deep dive on a concept, to produce some content.

- Github has a lot of tools to help you manage your project, discover them quickly to use them in your project.

Here is an example of a planning you could follow during the 4h of this project. Feel free to modify to better suit your needs.

## What Should you find on a Page

- The name of the concept
- A brief explanation with your own words
- A tutorial on when and how to do it (or your own git client)
- A figure explaining what is happening (e.g., a graph, branch visualization, etc)

You can have one main page and then one page per command/concept, or one page per categories of commands (e.g., branches, repositories, etc), complexity (basic /advanced concepts), or even one page with everything alphabetically ordered and a main menu.

### How to Start

1. Follow the link on moodle to create your team (find your name, create a new team or join an existing team)
2. All the group members clone the repository created for your team.
   ![](/ressources/clone_img.png)
3. One group member adds a HTML file with a basic skeleton (see below), and an empty stylesheet file (.css) to the repository, commit them, and push them.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="fr" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title> </title>
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

4. All the other group members pull to have the HTML and stylesheet files locally.
5. All group members work on their assigned tasks: don't forget to commit regularly !
6. When a group member is satisfied with the work done and want to share with the other ones, they push their changes. During this step, you may have to manage conflicts. Check difference (diff) with master and merge. Check your course or call the teacher if there are any problems.
