# Git Clients

There exist many git clients from the basic command line, to graphical client

| Client | Benefits | Drawbacks |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| CLI    | All the possibilites of Git | Steep learning curve. You need to learn the command, but in the end you only use a handful of command |
| SmartGit | Nice features to recover from mistake | Require a license. Busy user interface |
| Github Desktop | Easy integration with Github | No tree visualisation |
