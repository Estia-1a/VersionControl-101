# Collaborative work

Git and Github are great to work on collaborative works, in this activity you will create a website in groups of two, first alternating modifying the documents and then working concurrently:

## Create a shared repository

1. Create a repository

- Create **ONE** new repository on Github, you can initialize it with a Readme and a License (e.g. MIT)
- In Settings > Access > Add the other member of the group as an admin of the repository

2. Clone the repository (Both members)

## Contribute to the project

3. Repeat the step of the single-user projects

- One member creates an index.html, **stages**, **commits** and **pushes** his modification on the remote repository
- The other members pull the modification and add a paragraph **stages**, **commits** and **pushes** his modification on the remote repository
- Repeat several times (adding paragraph, CSS ...), before editing the files at same times. Commits and push as often as possible.
