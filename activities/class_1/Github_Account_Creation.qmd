### GitHub account creation

_Note_: If you already have a personal GitHub account you can use it, you can link it with your Estia address to get the [benefits](https://education.github.com/pack#offers) of being a student

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/signup) and create an account using your **estia email address**
2. You can select student and add your estia id card to get the benefits or skip this step and register later on [github education](https://education.github.com/)

This email address will be used to sign your commits, if you use it on public repository it will be visible. Github offers you the possibility to have a private email associated with your commits (you can't use it to receive mails.)

#### Get a private email address

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.
2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click **Emails**.
3. To keep your email address private when performing web-based Git operations, click **Keep my email addresses private**.![Image of checkbox to keep your email address private](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-31265/images/help/settings/email_privacy.png)
4. **Copy the email address (number-name@users.noreply.github.com) when you need to configure your git client.**
